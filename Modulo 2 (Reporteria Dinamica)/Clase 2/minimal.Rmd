title: A Minimal Example
---
We examine the relationship between speed and stopping
distance using a linear regression model:
$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$.
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1), mgp = c(2, 1, 0), cex = 0.8)
plot(cars, pch = 20, col = 'darkgray')
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
abline(fit, lwd = 2)
```

The slope of a simple linear regression is
`r coef(fit)[2]`.
